      "Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris defeated incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. He is the oldest president and the first to have a female vice president. His early presidential activity centered around proposing, lobbying for, and signing into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to help the United States recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession, as well as a series of executive orders. Biden's orders addressed the pandemic and reversed several Trump administration policies, including rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change and accepting new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, although a federal judge blocked the latter. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September 2021. During the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Biden signed into law in November 2021. In response to the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden led the imposition of international sanctions on Russia, authorizing over $1 billion in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n",
